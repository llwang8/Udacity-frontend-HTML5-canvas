Now that we know how to load images into the canvas,

0:00:03.580,0:00:06.680
let's start thinking about how we're actually going to start drawing on that.

0:00:06.680,0:00:09.810
To do so, I've gone ahead and changed out the code over here.

0:00:09.810,0:00:14.080
And instead of the image, I've switched in the methods fill rectangle and

0:00:14.080,0:00:15.770
stroke rectangle.

0:00:15.770,0:00:19.370
I've also made the canvas a little bit bigger if you're following along.

0:00:19.370,0:00:23.420
Fill rectangle and stroke rectangle work fairly, similarly.

0:00:23.420,0:00:24.730
Got their starting x and

0:00:24.730,0:00:29.400
y coordinates and then their widths and heights all patched in a parameters.

0:00:29.400,0:00:31.267
So let's go ahead and see what these two look like.

0:00:31.267,0:00:34.990
I will come over here and open up this document.

0:00:34.990,0:00:38.340
Cmd+O > Stroke Canvas > Open.

0:00:38.340,0:00:41.730
And we see that this code creates two different rectangles.

0:00:41.730,0:00:46.437
The filled rectangle starts at 100, 100 and has a width of 100, 100 and

0:00:46.437,0:00:49.035
that's this big black rectangle right here.

0:00:49.035,0:00:54.294
And the stroke rectangle starts at 50, 50 and is 50 by 50 pixels wide.

0:00:54.294,0:00:57.243
And that's this gray rectangle right here.

0:00:57.243,0:00:58.950
Or I guess you could call them squares,

0:00:58.950,0:01:00.880
because they have the same widths and heights.

0:01:00.880,0:01:05.269
But either way, this demo is to show that filled rectangles are filled in

0:01:05.269,0:01:08.080
with colors while stroke rectangles are not.
