You might be wondering how we're going to save the awesome images that we're

0:00:02.900,0:00:04.630
creating inside the canvas.

0:00:04.630,0:00:06.000
Let's go ahead and do that right now.

0:00:06.000,0:00:09.020
I'v opened up the HTML document that we've been building,

0:00:09.020,0:00:12.420
with this script inside that we're using to control the canvas.

0:00:12.420,0:00:14.700
And I've added these two lines here.

0:00:14.700,0:00:18.240
In this one, I've created a new variable called saved image, and

0:00:18.240,0:00:21.338
I've used this new method, toDataURL.

0:00:21.338,0:00:24.100
I'm calling toDataURL on c, which,

0:00:24.100,0:00:28.135
as you may recall, is the canvas object that we grabbed earlier.

0:00:28.135,0:00:31.540
toDataURL, creates a text string that represents the photo.

0:00:31.540,0:00:34.830
It can output a couple different image formats, but

0:00:34.830,0:00:36.500
we're only going to use the default for now.

0:00:36.500,0:00:40.250
So I've created this new text string representing the image.

0:00:40.250,0:00:44.600
And now I'll call window.open on the new save savedimage that we just created.

0:00:44.600,0:00:46.820
This should open the new image in a different window.

0:00:46.820,0:00:48.550
Let's go ahead, and see if it works.

0:00:48.550,0:00:53.210
I will save this and come over to the browser, and refresh, and OK.

0:00:53.210,0:00:56.425
It doesn't look like a new window is opening.

0:00:56.425,0:00:57.660
Okay, that's kind of weird.

0:00:57.660,0:00:59.058
Let's see if we can figure out what's going on here.

0:00:59.058,0:01:00.578
Uh-huh.

0:01:00.578,0:01:01.760
Okay.

0:01:01.760,0:01:06.370
So we're getting an error, which says that tainted canvases may not be exported.

0:01:06.370,0:01:07.740
This is an interesting problem.

0:01:07.740,0:01:11.330
There are a number of different ways to get around it but basically what it's

0:01:11.330,0:01:14.800
saying is that we need to figure out a way of safely hosting and

0:01:14.800,0:01:17.960
serving these images in order to save them.

0:01:17.960,0:01:20.180
Depending on your browser, you've got a few different options for

0:01:20.180,0:01:21.350
getting around it.

0:01:21.350,0:01:25.400
First off in Chrome you can actually just simply right click and hit Save image

0:01:25.400,0:01:31.280
as on whatever you want to save it, which is a really easy way of saving images.

0:01:31.280,0:01:35.310
Or you can take an even simpler out which is to simply take a screenshot, and

0:01:35.310,0:01:37.020
save your image that way.

0:01:37.020,0:01:39.920
But that isn't necessarily what we're going for here.

0:01:39.920,0:01:42.280
If you want to actually be able to export these and

0:01:42.280,0:01:45.360
to save them later without right-clicking on them you actually have to

0:01:45.360,0:01:50.150
create your own server, running probably on your local machine or online.

0:01:50.150,0:01:54.580
And the steps to do so are definitely outside the scope of this course, but

0:01:54.580,0:01:56.710
you can check out some of the links in the instructor notes for

0:01:56.710,0:01:59.200
more details on how to do that yourself.

0:01:59.200,0:02:02.245
But for now if you want to save an image using chrome you can just simply

0:02:02.245,0:02:07.020
right-click on the image and that should work, or you can take a screenshot or,

0:02:07.020,0:02:09.620
you know, if you're feeling ambitious check out the instructor notes to

0:02:09.620,0:02:11.980
