So this is what I came up with.

0:00:02.680,0:00:04.380
Remember, this is the shape that we're going for.

0:00:05.420,0:00:08.970
I started off by drawing the outer rectangle by using strokeRect.

0:00:08.970,0:00:14.120
We wanted it to start at 50, 50 and then it needs to be 100 by 100 pixels wide.

0:00:14.120,0:00:15.450
Then we began the path.

0:00:15.450,0:00:16.350
The path starts at 75, 75.

0:00:16.350,0:00:20.290
So that just takes the pen and moves it here.

0:00:20.290,0:00:24.910
Then we move it to 125, 125, but we create a line there.

0:00:24.910,0:00:28.020
So the pen goes down and moves over.

0:00:28.020,0:00:30.020
Then we create a line up to 125,

0:00:30.020,0:00:34.710
75 which takes the pen back up, and then actually we can stop there.

0:00:34.710,0:00:38.130
With that shape, with that drawing, we can actually start to fill in.

0:00:38.130,0:00:40.710
So, then we call fill and we'll get this.

0:00:40.710,0:00:42.840
Let's go ahead and see if this code works.

0:00:42.840,0:00:47.050
Okay. I've saved the file let's come over here and hit refresh, and low and

0:00:47.050,0:00:49.380
behold we see the shape that we were going for.

0:00:49.380,0:00:51.990
At this point you got the basics down for drawing.

0:00:51.990,0:00:54.070
I recommend having some fun with it.

0:00:54.070,0:00:57.480
See what kind of cool, crazy drawings you can make and post them in the forums.
