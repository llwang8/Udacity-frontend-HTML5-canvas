Let's take a look at what we've done inside a redraw meme.

0:00:03.060,0:00:05.430
First things first, we need to draw the image.

0:00:05.430,0:00:09.270
We check to see if the image exists by making sure it's not null, and

0:00:09.270,0:00:13.460
then we use context.draw image to draw the image inside the canvas.

0:00:13.460,0:00:16.329
Then we start creating our text attributes.

0:00:16.329,0:00:20.780
Just like before, we set a font, we align it to center, we set the strokes to

0:00:20.780,0:00:24.840
black with a width of three, and then set the fills to white.

0:00:24.840,0:00:25.390
At this point,

0:00:25.390,0:00:28.790
we could start drawing text, which is exactly what we start doing here.

0:00:28.790,0:00:30.880
We want to make sure we have a top line and

0:00:30.880,0:00:34.640
if we do, we draw the fill text first and then the stroke text.

0:00:34.640,0:00:39.110
Notice that we're using the same canvas.width over two trick that we did before.

0:00:39.110,0:00:42.360
This makes sure that the text shows up at the center of the Then we

0:00:42.360,0:00:43.980
do the same thing with the bottom text.

0:00:43.980,0:00:47.840
The only difference between the top text and the bottom text is the y position.

0:00:47.840,0:00:51.570
Here we have y position at 40 pixels which is towards the top.

0:00:51.570,0:00:54.820
And then for the y position at the bottom, we're going to select the canvas

0:00:54.820,0:00:57.480
height and then just subtract 20 pixels from it.

0:00:57.480,0:01:00.360
Remember, the canvas height here is going to be a big number, but

0:01:00.360,0:01:03.060
the y coordinates get bigger the farther down you go.

0:01:03.060,0:01:04.160
So this makes sense.

0:01:04.160,0:01:07.770
This makes us 20 pixels above the bottom of the canvas.

0:01:07.770,0:01:09.360
And with that, we should be good to go.

0:01:09.360,0:01:10.360
Let's take a look.

0:01:10.360,0:01:12.470
Okay, I've got the meme generator over here.

0:01:12.470,0:01:13.570
Let's go ahead and open a file.

0:01:14.830,0:01:16.890
And I've got myself as the background.

0:01:16.890,0:01:19.360
I'll set the top text to CAM BE LIKE.

0:01:19.360,0:01:25.940
And let's say the bottom text is going to say, I don't know, CANVAS IS AWESOME.

0:01:25.940,0:01:28.330
Let's go ahead and hit save, and see if that works.

0:01:28.330,0:01:30.000
And yeah, we've got our image to save.

0:01:30.000,0:01:34.260
I will right click, save image as, and put it on the desktop.

0:01:34.260,0:01:36.950
And with that, we've got our simple meme maker.
