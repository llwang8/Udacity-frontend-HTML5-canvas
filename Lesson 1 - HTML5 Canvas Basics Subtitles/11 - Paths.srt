There are other ways of drawing with the canvas as well and

0:00:03.190,0:00:05.040
I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate one right here.

0:00:05.040,0:00:06.750
It begins with this command,

0:00:06.750,0:00:10.210
BeginPath which we're calling on the context of the campus.

0:00:10.210,0:00:13.420
BeginPath tells the canvas that we're about to draw a new shape.

0:00:13.420,0:00:15.350
Then we use this command MoveTo.

0:00:15.350,0:00:18.680
Now with moveTo and LineTo it makes actually a lot of sense to

0:00:18.680,0:00:21.865
think about a pen actually moving on page.

0:00:21.865,0:00:26.260
MoveTo moves a pen to a specific location on the canvas which is designated by

0:00:26.260,0:00:28.300
the x and y coordinate here.

0:00:28.300,0:00:33.370
So this command moves the pen to 10, 10 which is going to be about right here.

0:00:33.370,0:00:35.810
You can think of move to as just moving the pen but

0:00:35.810,0:00:37.770
the pen isn't making a mark yet.

0:00:37.770,0:00:39.940
We're just deciding where we want to put it down on the page.

0:00:39.940,0:00:43.800
But then when we call LineTo we actually put the pen down.

0:00:43.800,0:00:47.850
And make his mark or in this case align to this position.

0:00:47.850,0:00:50.750
So this line here with MoveTo 10,10.

0:00:50.750,0:00:53.270
Moves the pen or hovers it over 10,10.

0:00:53.270,0:00:56.120
Then when we call LineTo, we put the pen down and

0:00:56.120,0:00:58.600
then move it to the position of 50, 50.

0:00:58.600,0:01:01.560
Then we move it again and move it again.

0:01:01.560,0:01:04.860
If we refresh the page we'll see that there's nothing there

0:01:04.860,0:01:08.260
despite the fact that it looks like we made a shape that eventually goes back to

0:01:08.260,0:01:09.890
where we started at 10, 10.

0:01:09.890,0:01:11.930
That's because we need to call either a fill or

0:01:11.930,0:01:14.050
a stroke command to finish up this path.

0:01:14.050,0:01:15.860
Let's start by doing fill.

0:01:15.860,0:01:19.920
I will go ahead and uncomment this line and save, come over here and

0:01:19.920,0:01:21.280
hit Refresh.

0:01:21.280,0:01:23.550
And we see that we create a filled shape.

0:01:23.550,0:01:27.350
This made a triangle, so now we see a filled in triangle.

0:01:27.350,0:01:31.230
If we comment in fill and then un-comment stroke, let's see what happens.

0:01:31.230,0:01:32.480
We'll save.

0:01:32.480,0:01:33.420
Come over here and

0:01:33.420,0:01:38.220
hit Refresh and now we see a stroke triangle that's not filled in.

0:01:38.220,0:01:41.040
There are many other drawing commands that you can use in the canvas and

0:01:41.040,0:01:43.910
check out the link in the instructor notes if you want to learn more about them.

0:01:43.910,0:01:46.600
But most of them behave similarly to what we see here.

0:01:46.600,0:01:49.200
For this quiz we want you to recreate the shape that you

0:01:49.200,0:01:51.330
see here with the canvas.

0:01:51.330,0:01:51.870
I've gone ahead and

0:01:51.870,0:01:56.080
marked a few points on the outside square and the inside triangle.

0:01:56.080,0:01:59.370
This should make your life a little bit easier as you try to recreate it.

0:01:59.370,0:02:01.410
After you've finished it, check this box to continue.
