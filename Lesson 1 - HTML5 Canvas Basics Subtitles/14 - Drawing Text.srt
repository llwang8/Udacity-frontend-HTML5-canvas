Okay, so I've gone ahead and pulled up a meme of myself.

0:00:04.380,0:00:07.660
And let's analyze the way this text is drawn.

0:00:07.660,0:00:11.860
Memes tend to use white text that is outlined in black.

0:00:11.860,0:00:15.810
This makes it easy to read the text no matter what background it's over.

0:00:15.810,0:00:18.820
So in this case, the like here is on top of a light background, but

0:00:18.820,0:00:21.110
we can read it really easily because of the black outline.

0:00:21.110,0:00:24.510
And then down here, over my dark shirt because the letters have

0:00:24.510,0:00:28.270
white fills inside they're easily legible there too.

0:00:28.270,0:00:31.970
So this is a nice strategy for making sure that text is always legible.

0:00:31.970,0:00:36.410
The way this is accomplished is with a mix of fill and stroke text.

0:00:36.410,0:00:39.470
To the scripts I've added this method, stroke text.

0:00:39.470,0:00:43.500
Which is going to draw the string hello udacity.

0:00:43.500,0:00:45.540
And it's going to put it at the point 50, 10.

0:00:45.540,0:00:48.320
Now, note here that this 50 is going to be,

0:00:48.320,0:00:52.320
in the case of this text, the lower left-hand corner of the text.

0:00:52.320,0:00:52.971
So, if this were 0,

0:00:52.971,0:00:56.970
0 we wouldn't be able to see the text because the lower left-hand corner

0:00:56.970,0:00:59.780
would be at zero and the rest of the text wouldn't be above the page.

0:00:59.780,0:01:01.630
So that's just something to know.

0:01:01.630,0:01:03.930
Let's go ahead and see what happens when we call this method.

0:01:03.930,0:01:06.170
Come over here and hit Refresh.

0:01:06.170,0:01:09.605
And we can see that we now have a hello udacity written in

0:01:09.605,0:01:14.326
the same green color that we set earlier drawn at the position 50, 10.

0:01:14.326,0:01:18.450
This string here could be any string and we can use JavaScript to set it.

0:01:18.450,0:01:20.110
We could also use fillText instead.

0:01:21.190,0:01:22.570
I'll go ahead and save that.

0:01:22.570,0:01:24.030
Now we've got fillText.

0:01:24.030,0:01:26.730
I'll come over here and hit refresh, and

0:01:26.730,0:01:31.110
we've got hello udacity written in the same blue color that we set here.

0:01:31.110,0:01:34.450
In addition to letting us decide what strings to draw on the page and

0:01:34.450,0:01:38.310
where to draw them, the Canvas 2D context allows us to set a lot of

0:01:38.310,0:01:42.890
other options, like for instance, font size, font style, and line width.

0:01:42.890,0:01:44.660
