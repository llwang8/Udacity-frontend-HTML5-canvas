0:00:00.180,0:00:01.170
Let's start with A.

0:00:01.170,0:00:04.300
Going up we can see that we're at 2 on the x axis.

0:00:04.300,0:00:06.850
And we're at the same level as this point over here.

0:00:06.850,0:00:08.940
So we're at 1 on the y axis.

0:00:08.940,0:00:11.480
So we've got 2, 1.

0:00:11.480,0:00:13.010
Next up looking at B.

0:00:13.010,0:00:15.110
We are one line over.

0:00:15.110,0:00:17.570
So we know that the x has to be 3.

0:00:17.570,0:00:21.420
And we've gone down one, so our y is 2.

0:00:21.420,0:00:22.530
Last but not least with C,

0:00:22.530,0:00:28.320
we're at 1 on the x axis and we're at now 3 on the y axis.

0:00:28.320,0:00:29.730
So we've got 1, 3.

0:00:29.730,0:00:30.590
Important to note,

0:00:30.590,0:00:35.310
these are not negative numbers, these are positive numbers on the y axis.

0:00:35.310,0:00:37.700
The y axis gets more positive the farther down you go.
