At Udacity sometimes we have a little bit too much fun making memes.

0:00:05.760,0:00:06.810
In fact I just searched for

0:00:06.810,0:00:10.730
meme and all of these plus a lot more showed up in my inbox.

0:00:10.730,0:00:13.560
We apparently send these out all the time.

0:00:13.560,0:00:16.670
In fact one time James even sent out an entire email about

0:00:16.670,0:00:20.130
the programming language Swift using Taylor Swift memes.

0:00:20.130,0:00:22.470
So we, yeah, probably have too much fun.

I hear this one came out of web performance because I'm

0:00:25.330,0:00:26.920
making kind of a funny face.

0:00:26.920,0:00:28.240
No idea where this one came from but

0:00:28.240,0:00:31.490
that's Jared who makes classes at Georgia Tech.

0:00:31.490,0:00:35.450
This is Ben who's favorite thing in the world is to make Chrome extensions.

0:00:35.450,0:00:39.420
In fact, it comes up in almost every conversation about some type of

0:00:39.420,0:00:40.645
new technology.

0:00:40.645,0:00:42.900
Ben'll be like, hey, I could make a Chrome extension for that.

0:00:42.900,0:00:45.330
So of course, I had to make a meme about him.

0:00:45.330,0:00:49.380
But I think my all-time favorite meme in my inbox is this one.

0:00:49.380,0:00:53.280
To give you a little bit of background we have Fancy Friday every other Friday,

0:00:53.280,0:00:56.820
where instead of trying to dress up like normal tech workers, who are always

0:00:56.820,0:00:59.940
wearing jeans and T-shirts, we try to put on something different, you know?

0:00:59.940,0:01:01.490
Wear something nice.

0:01:01.490,0:01:03.380
And this is David in the background here.

0:01:03.380,0:01:06.000
And I don't know what's going on here.

0:01:06.000,0:01:08.730
Apparently this is fancy.

0:01:08.730,0:01:09.500
But who knows?

0:01:09.500,0:01:12.310
So I've gone ahead and shown you some of our favorite memes.

0:01:12.310,0:01:14.810
But now we want to know what your favorite meme is.

0:01:14.810,0:01:18.500
