So this is what I've come up with.

0:00:01.630,0:00:06.520
I've used the font method on the context and set it to 36 point impact and

0:00:06.520,0:00:09.380
I've set the textAlign property on the context to center.

0:00:09.380,0:00:12.960
You didn't have to do this, but you'll see why this is cool in a second.

0:00:12.960,0:00:16.239
For the internal fillText, I set it to white.

0:00:16.239,0:00:19.040
Then I set the fillText to CANVAS MEMES!,

0:00:19.040,0:00:22.350
with an x position starting at half the width of the canvas and

0:00:22.350,0:00:23.828
a y position of 40.

0:00:23.828,0:00:26.590
This x position plus this text alignment of

0:00:26.590,0:00:29.620
center makes sure that our text is centered on the page.

0:00:29.620,0:00:32.800
Then for the strokes, I set the style to black,

0:00:32.800,0:00:37.020
I set the line width to 3, then I finish up with the strokeText method,

0:00:37.020,0:00:40.760
which takes in the same parameters as the fillText method from before.

0:00:40.760,0:00:43.420
Let's go ahead and save this and see how it looks.

0:00:43.420,0:00:46.160
Coming over to the browser, we see our Canvas Memes!,

0:00:46.160,0:00:48.690
with white text and a black outline.

0:00:48.690,0:00:50.590
Looks like we're ready to start making some memes.
