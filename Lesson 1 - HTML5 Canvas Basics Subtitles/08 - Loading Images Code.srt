if there's one thing that any good meme needs, it is an awesome picture.

0:00:04.710,0:00:07.970
If we were doing this in HTML, we could make an image appear on the screen by

0:00:07.970,0:00:12.840
using the img tag and setting a source to something this fake image.

0:00:12.840,0:00:15.790
But we're doing this with canvas, so let's get rid of this line.

0:00:15.790,0:00:19.170
So, we'll start by creating a new image, which we'll call image.

0:00:19.170,0:00:20.270
because why not?

0:00:20.270,0:00:22.910
And we'll set it equal to a new Image object.

0:00:22.910,0:00:27.830
Down here, we'll set this source property of the image object to this file,

0:00:27.830,0:00:30.130
which I've got saved to my local machine.

0:00:30.130,0:00:33.330
This is part of the power of using the canvas to draw on the screen.

0:00:33.330,0:00:37.010
We can use a local file as well as any file on the Internet, so

0:00:37.010,0:00:41.150
if you've found a cool image online, you could put that URL right here or

0:00:41.150,0:00:44.180
just use a link to the file on your local machine.

0:00:44.180,0:00:46.930
Images in JavaScript get loaded asynchronously,

0:00:46.930,0:00:49.610
which means that we need to do work after it's loaded,

0:00:49.610,0:00:54.460
so we'll set the onload function on the image object to what we've got here.

0:00:54.460,0:00:58.900
In this case we'll console.log Loaded image, and then we'll doSomethingElse.

0:00:58.900,0:01:00.460
Let's be a little bit more specific about what we

0:01:00.460,0:01:02.270
want to happen after the image is loaded.

0:01:02.270,0:01:06.555
We'll go ahead and grab the ctx again that we created up here and

0:01:06.555,0:01:09.770
call the drawImage method on the ctx of the canvas.

0:01:09.770,0:01:13.640
Into the drawImage method, we'll pass the image itself along with its

0:01:13.640,0:01:18.480
starting coordinates, x and y, and its width and height, which in this case

0:01:18.480,0:01:22.730
we're setting to the same width and height as the canvas itself inside the DOM.

0:01:22.730,0:01:24.670
Let's go ahead and see if this works.

0:01:24.670,0:01:26.190
So we've got the file saved over here.

0:01:26.190,0:01:29.930
And inside my browser, I'll go ahead and open up this HTML file.

0:01:29.930,0:01:33.650
And we can see it's saved right here on my local machine in the same directory

0:01:33.650,0:01:38.210
as that fry_fixed image that we set the source of the image to right here.

0:01:38.210,0:01:39.730
So let's go ahead and open it up.

0:01:39.730,0:01:40.450
And voil√†!

0:01:40.450,0:01:41.820
We see the image appear.

0:01:41.820,0:01:44.590
