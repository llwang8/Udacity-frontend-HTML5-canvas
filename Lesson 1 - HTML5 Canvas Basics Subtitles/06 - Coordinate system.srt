We've got our canvas and

0:00:01.819,0:00:04.240
now we need to start thinking about how we're going to draw on it.

0:00:04.240,0:00:06.610
To draw on the canvas, we're going to need to use coordinates.

0:00:06.610,0:00:08.210
Otherwise, how will the computer know where we

0:00:08.210,0:00:10.110
want our awesome drawings to end up?

0:00:10.110,0:00:12.830
In geometry class we use the cartesian coordinates system,

0:00:12.830,0:00:13.990
which looks like this.

0:00:13.990,0:00:17.070
The cartesian system has the X axis going from left to right, and

0:00:17.070,0:00:19.120
the Y axis going from bottom to top.

0:00:19.120,0:00:21.610
0, 0's right in the middle and any numbers below 0,

0:00:21.610,0:00:23.940
0 are negative on the Y axis.

0:00:23.940,0:00:28.090
And any numbers to the left of 0, 0 are negative on the X axis.

0:00:28.090,0:00:30.710
The canvas's coordinate system is a little bit different.

0:00:30.710,0:00:35.350
Here 0, 0 is in the top left, and our x numbers just get bigger as you

0:00:35.350,0:00:39.360
go to the right and our y numbers get bigger as you go down.

0:00:39.360,0:00:42.750
This is different than geometry class where number got more positive

0:00:42.750,0:00:43.780
as you go up.

0:00:43.780,0:00:44.770
So, they're opposites in a way.

0:00:44.770,0:00:46.600
Keep that in mind.

0:00:46.600,0:00:48.800
Let's take a look at a couple examples.

0:00:48.800,0:00:49.420
On this grid,

0:00:49.420,0:00:53.430
I'm counting ten lines as one, because these lines are too close together.

0:00:53.430,0:00:56.900
We've gone over ten lines, which we're counting as one, so we have x1.

0:00:56.900,0:01:00.060
And, we haven't gone down at all so y is still 0.

0:01:00.060,0:01:04.870
Looking at this one, we haven't gone anywhere on the x axis, so x is still 0.

0:01:04.870,0:01:08.270
But we've gone down ten lines or one line in this example.

0:01:08.270,0:01:09.340
So the y is 1.

0:01:09.340,0:01:12.080
For this last point, we've gone over ten lines.

0:01:12.080,0:01:14.050
So our x is 1.

0:01:14.050,0:01:15.920
And we've also gone down ten lines.

0:01:15.920,0:01:17.620
So our y is 1.

0:01:17.620,0:01:20.110
It's important that you get used to the canvas coordinate system,

0:01:20.110,0:01:22.090
because you're going to be using it quite a bit.

0:01:22.090,0:01:24.530
To get you started I've marked off three points.

0:01:24.530,0:01:25.730
A, B, and C.

0:01:25.730,0:01:28.100
See if you can figure out their coordinates.

0:01:28.100,0:01:32.070
I've also gone ahead and marked off the next whole numbers on the y axis and

0:01:32.070,0:01:34.990
the next whole numbers on the x axis to make your life a little bit easier.

0:01:34.990,0:01:35.930
