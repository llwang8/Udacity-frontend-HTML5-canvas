Before we dive into the canvas let's take a look at what we'll be building.

0:00:04.760,0:00:08.540
>> Huh. You know, it looks like there's a lot going on there.

0:00:08.540,0:00:11.020
Shouldn't we start with something a little simpler?

0:00:11.020,0:00:11.921
>> How about this one?

0:00:11.921,0:00:13.400
>> Oh, this is a lot better.

0:00:13.400,0:00:15.700
We can totally build this within a lesson or two.

0:00:15.700,0:00:17.430
But I've got one question.

0:00:17.430,0:00:20.440
Why exactly are we building a meme generator?

0:00:20.440,0:00:21.460
>> That's a good question.

0:00:21.460,0:00:24.390
Let's say you have a website that you want to add some sort of chart or

0:00:24.390,0:00:28.250
maps to, like the resume project we did in JavaScript Basics.

0:00:28.250,0:00:32.890
It is possible to do that with some artful positioning of HTML tags in CSS or

0:00:32.890,0:00:36.200
even Flash, but it's much easier to do with Canvas.

0:00:36.200,0:00:40.520
Right, Canvas has a set of functions that allow us to draw shapes, images, text,

0:00:40.520,0:00:41.570
and patterns.

0:00:41.570,0:00:43.920
And instead of working through a bunch of examples with charts and

0:00:43.920,0:00:46.400
data, we thought it'd be fun to make some memes.
